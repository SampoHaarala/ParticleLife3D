# ParticleLife3D
Physics project inspired by Particle Life. I want to see if I can make the particle life model support 3-dimensions of space and create particles that modify space other particles move in.
I decided to take it up a notch and create it in up to 5 dimensions. I am trying to make some special dimensions such as time and parallel dimensions(superpositions) work to try out my ideas.
Made in Unity.
